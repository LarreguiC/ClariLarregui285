         <h2> What Constitutes a creative web project today?</h2>
         <p> A creative web project can be about any topic. It can tell a story, an idea or it can bring on a discussion. These discussions can vary from the arts, a performance, political, social issues and even more. With every event that occurs in our world a web project can bring on an impact in order to create positive changes. Every web project always has a goal to be achieved, and most web projects do rely on on viewers who are persuading to take a small part of that project in order to make it happen. A successful a creative web project can happen if a creative team is able to capture the eye of the viewer and is able to appeal them in a unique way. This can happen if the web page design is appealing, if the goal of the project is for the greater good and so much more.</p>
         <h2> How do each of you wish to employ the web of the internet as a creative platform</h2>
         <p> As a creative platform on the web for me, I wish to use my creative platform personally as an art gallery for all of my works that are media based. I want to be able to show others my experience in order to work for a media company in the future</p>
         <h2> What are your goals in this course?</h2>
         <p> My goals in this course is to be able to gain more coding experience as well as being able to make successful and creative webpages to shows to others in the career field. I overall just want to learn more about web production, and have fun with being creative and grow my experience since I am a beginner.</p>
